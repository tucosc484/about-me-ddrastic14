## 1. What is your developer journey so far? What brought you to this major, and why did you take this class?
What brought me to this major was a love for technology from mobile all the way to desktop. While I had never programmed before college I decided to give it a try at my first semester of community college, a little over two years ago. After I had taken an introductory course in Java, I found that I really enjoyed the fundamentals of how everyday applications that I used worked behind the scenes, from the various methods all the way up to the structure of a class. From there I took classes that dealt with more advanced programming topics such as data structures with lists, queues, and stacks to even more trending application development with Android Studio. The reason I'm taking this class is because my experience with markup languages and scripting languages is basically nonexistent. So to have this experience I feel is important to broaden my scope of different programming disciplines. Also I've never developed for the web so I'm curious to see how it works.

## 2. What is your ideal career progression, if there were no limitations?
My ideal career progression, given no limitations, would be to start out as a developer who is proficient in a single discipline of development (like mobile), and progress to eventually being a full stack developer. Since I know Java and have experience with Android Studio, I would start my career as an Android app developer. As I learned other mobile app development languages such as Swift for iOS, I would progress myself to being a mobile app stack developer, meaning that I would be proficient in all languages pertaining to developing for mobile, that mainly being iOS and Android. From there, ideally I would go to being a stack developer in the four other fields of development, mainly being front end development, backend development, databases, and devops. While this is a tall order to achieve, I feel the ability to have an understanding of all aspects of development would make my career opportunities more open, as I could jump into any aspect of developing applications and help out.

## 3.	What programming experience do you have? Do you have any web experience?
I have programmed primarily in Java and C++. In terms of Java experience I have programmed basic text based and GUI based applications in the Eclipse IDE. In addition to this I have also used Java in mobile app development via Android Studio to make GUI based mobile applications that can run on Android smartphones. As far as my C++ experience goes I have made basic text based applicatios in the Netbeans IDE and Visual Studio IDE. In addition to high level languages I've also coded basic x86 assembly programs as well using Visual Studio. These included basic print statements, input from the user, and arrays. I have zero exprience coding for the web.
